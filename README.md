*DESCRIPTION*: This project involves building a multithreaded client-server chat application using Java sockets and multithreading. The server will listen for incoming client connections and create a separate thread for each connected client, allowing multiple users to communicate simultaneously in real time. Each client will be able to send and receive messages through the server, which broadcasts messages to all connected clients. The application demonstrates practical use of Javaâ€™s networking and concurrency APIs. The deliverable is a fully functional chat system with a server program and client programs capable of real-time group chatting.
